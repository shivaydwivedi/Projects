## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone or Download** this repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
3. See the live clock and toggle themes as you wish!

---

## 💡 How It Works

- Uses `setInterval()` to update the time every second.
- `Date` object is used to fetch the current hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Converts time from **24-hour format** to **12-hour with AM/PM**.
- `Theme Toggle` button switches between `light` and `dark` classes on `<body>` using JavaScript.
- CSS handles the styling based on the active theme.
